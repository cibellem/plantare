# plantare


Plantare is an Ecommerce plant store built with React, Node and MongoDB.

In this application my main goal was to learn more about Unit Tests and to get exposure to Agile technologies such as Jira Software. 

For my Unit Tests I used Enzyme and Jasmine. Following some great resources online I shallowed tested my components to check if they were being rendered correctly.
